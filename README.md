Noid Linux (Naz's Void Linux-based iso) is my personal customization of Void Linux. It's tailored to my preferences and comes with a custom XBPS repository enabled out of the box.

## Features

- **Minimal Base System**: Built on Void Linux's lightweight foundation
- **Custom XBPS Repository**: Additional packages and modifications I find useful

## Note on Project Scope

This is primarily a personal project that I use for my own systems. The repository is public for reference and transparency, but I maintain it according to my own needs and preferences. While I'm happy to accept pull requests that align with the project's direction, significant changes or improvements may be better implemented by forking this project.
